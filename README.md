**Flutter SQLFlite CRUD Operations**

This repository contains a Flutter project demonstrating basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using SQLFlite, a local database package for Flutter apps.

**Features:**

**SQLite Database Setup**: Utilizes SQLFlite to establish a local SQLite database within a Flutter application.
**CRUD Operations**: Enables creating, reading, updating, and deleting entries (items) within the database.
**User Interface**: Provides a user interface built with Flutter widgets to interact with the database, allowing users to add, view, edit, and delete items.
**Modal Bottom Sheet**: Implements a modal bottom sheet for adding or updating items.

This project showcases the integration of SQLFlite for managing local data storage in Flutter applications, offering a foundational structure for more complex data handling requirements
